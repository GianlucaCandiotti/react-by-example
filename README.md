# React.js By Example

This repository contains various React.js examples. Its means are just to get people started on how to set up React.js different ways, show how to use it in combination with other libraries, showcase different syntaxes and keep growing with time by adding more examples. Please take everything with a grain of salt and consider that these examples are in no way implying they are the correct way to handle data or communication between components, these are just self contained examples that must be used as reference and nothing else.
